django_testview 
---------------

Have you changed your app css recently?  Want to know 
if you've affected other pages, but don't want to do a 
lot of typing or data entry?  django_testview lets you 
click through a series of pre-defined urls so you can 
view every page of your app as part of standard 
pre-deployment testing.
